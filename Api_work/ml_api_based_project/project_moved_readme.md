## Why This Move?

This project was originally part of my daily data science work repository (`data_science_daily_work/Api_work/ml_api_based_project`), but I've moved it to a standalone repository for the following reasons:

✅ **Better Project Visibility** - A dedicated repository makes it easier for others to discover and understand the project

✅ **Cleaner Organization** - Separating production-ready projects from experimental/learning work

✅ **Independent Version Control** - Allows focused tracking of changes specific to this project

✅ **Professional Portfolio** - Showcases this as a complete, standalone ML application

✅ **Easier Collaboration** - Makes it simpler for others to fork, contribute, or use the project
